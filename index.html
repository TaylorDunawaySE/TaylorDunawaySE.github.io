                        <p class="blackbox">Digital Commons is a portfolio of applications to allow institutions and researchers to showcase their work. 
                            The team currently consists of 4 squads with a Quality Engineer on each squad. The tech stacks for each squad vary from Java
                            to Python based, and the cloud provider used is AWS. I am responsible for setting a high bar for the quality of Digital Commons. This involves
                            managing the growth and careers of the QEs, providing technical direction, and making high quality contributions to build pipelines,
                            automation projects, and misc. tooling.

                    <h3>Trimble Earthworks GO! 2.0</h3>
                    <p class="blackbox">Trimle Earthworks GO 2.0 was a replatforming of an existing local contractor oriented grade control application.
                        EWGO is a mobile app that interfaces over bluetooth with the on machine ECM and blade slope sensor to provide blade slope information to the user, and
                        semi-autonomous control over the blade. In a nutshell, this system assists the local contractor in attaining precision grading. My role on this project 
                        ended up being very generalist in nature. I implemented many cross platform features for both Android & iOS. I maintained the build system and served
                        as the Testing lead. When the integrated circuit shortage put the project on hold, I worked with the controls engineering team to build a inhibit controller
                        to research the effectivesness of using an excavator's hydraulic valve to stop movement of the boom and bucket. Overall, I used many technologies
                        and learned a ton about an industry that was unfamiliar to me.

                    <h3>Identity Plus</h3>
                    <p class="blackbox">I joined Elsevier as part of a recent graduate scheme, and was assigned to the ID+ project. This project had the goal 
                        of providing SSO between the suite Elsevier's products. My role in the project varied as I moved between Software Engineering
                        and Quality Engineering roles. By the end of my tenure I had developed automation frameworks for various teams, implemented both front end
                        and backend features for ID+, fixed a lot of bugs, and learned a ton. My final days were spent serving as a technical advisor to several testing groups,
                        and building a consolidated testing framework to be shared by several teams. My greatest acheivement during this time was a p.o.c. that I implemented
                        to explore A.I. driven automated testing. For this work I was invited to both London and New York to share my project.
